# BirdsongML
An ML model designed to analyze repeating motifs in bird singing.

# How to run
 - Clear the contents of the output_segments folder.
 - In birdsong.py modify the filepath to your sound file (or keep it as is if you wish to use my recording.)
 - Run birdsong.py
 - Run note_analysis.py (gif generation might take a while, you can tweak the frame rate if it takes too long)
